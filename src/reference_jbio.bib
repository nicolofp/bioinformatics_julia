    abstract = {limma is an R/Bioconductor software package that provides an integrated solution for analysing data from gene expression experiments. It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.},

  abstract = "Background and Purpose- Numerous studies have shown that
              circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) can be used as noninvasive
              biomarkers of various diseases. This study aimed to identify
              serum miRNAs that predict the risk of stroke. Methods- The cases
              were individuals who had been diagnosed with cerebrovascular
              disorder by brain imaging. The controls were individuals with no
              history of stroke who had undergone a medical checkup. Serum
              miRNA profiling was performed for all participants using
              microarray analysis. Samples were divided into discovery,
              training, and validation sets. In the discovery set, which
              consisted of control samples only, serum miRNAs that correlated
              with the predicted risk of stroke, as calculated using 7 clinical
              risk factors, were identified by Pearson correlation analysis. In
              the training set, a discriminant model between cases and controls
              was constructed using the identified miRNAs, Fisher linear
              discrimination model with leave-one-out cross-validation and
              DeLong test. In the validation set, the predictive accuracy of
              the constructed model was calculated. Results- First, in 1523
              control samples (discovery set), we identified 10 miRNAs that
              correlated with a predicted risk of stroke. Second, in 45
              controls and 87 cases (training set), we identified 7 of 10
              miRNAs that significantly associated with cerebrovascular
              disorder (miR-1228-5p, miR-1268a, miR-1268b, miR-4433b-3p,
              miR-6090, miR-6752-5p, and miR-6803-5p). Third, a 3-miRNA
              combination model (miR-1268b, miR-4433b-3p, and miR-6803-5p) was
              constructed in the training set with a sensitivity of 84\%, a
              specificity of 98\%, and an area under the receiver operating
              characteristic curve of 0.95 (95\% CI, 0.92-0.98). Finally, in 45
              controls and 86 cases (validation set), the 3-miRNA model
              achieved a sensitivity of 80\%, a specificity of 82\%, and an
              area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.89 (95\%
              CI, 0.83-0.95) for cerebrovascular disorder. Conclusions- We
              identified 7 serum miRNAs that could predict the risk of
              cerebrovascular disorder before the onset of stroke.",
